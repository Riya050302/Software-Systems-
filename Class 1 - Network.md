# Software Systems 

An application process running on a network needs to open a socket to the transport layer protocol,
either UDP or TCP, to begin communication with another application process somewhere else on the
network. The purpose of this class is to get some hands-on experience of socket programming, in order
to help us better understand the application and transport layer concepts which will be covered in
future lectures.
